# About Me

<img src="Yuhang.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Yuhang Wang (Henry, 王雨航)**.

I am a PhD student majoring in Civil Engineering Transportation at University of South Florida. Currently, I serve as a research assistant at the MOTIF-Lab, advised by [Prof. Hao Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/haozhou-cv). I also spent a lovely one year research program with [Prof. Peng Song](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/peng-song/#research) at Singapore University of Technology and Design.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *yuhangw[at]usf[dot]edu*

## Research Interests

- Autonomous Vehicles
- Traffic Security
- Driver Assisted System
- Large Language Models
- Computer graphics

My current research focuses on applying deep learning and the features of self-driving vehicles to solve transportation problems. I believe that the combination of old theories and emerging technologies can help alleviate the problem of traffic congestion and ensure traffic safety. I am also committed to a human-centered approach and to researching automated driver assistance systems that are more suitable for a wide range of people and that add to the driver's driving experience. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
